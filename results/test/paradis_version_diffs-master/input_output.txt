INPUT:

paradis_default: 
	*run_name*.ctrl -- file containing the control parameters (see ParaDiSUsersGuide-V2.5.1-Pub.pdf)
	*run_name*.data -- file containing the initial nodal positions, neighbours and Burgers vectors of the discretized dislocations

paradis_grand_challenge and paradis_optimized:
	*run_name*.ctrl -- similar to the default version but with some possible additional parameter options (for instance implemented loading types such as the quasistatic stress ramp)	
	*run_name*.data -- similar to the default version
	*run_name*.pdata -- file containing the initial positions and parameters of the precipitates; follows the structure of the *.data file

OUTPUT:



paradis_default:
	see ParaDiSUsersGuide-V2.5.1-Pub.pdf

paradis_grand_challenge:
	writes also a file properties/avalanche which contains columns [time, average velocity, plastic strain, applied stress]

paradis_optimized:
	writes also a file properties/avalanche which contains columns [time, average velocity, plastic strain, applied stress, total dislocation length, integrated strain rate]
	The average velocity is calculate as a segement weighted average velocity of dislocations.
